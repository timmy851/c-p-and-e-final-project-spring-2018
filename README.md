# The RC Bull (You can't control me)

We propose to build an RC car that acts as a bull, where the user can control the animal’s
movement and direction with a remote control, but when the vehicle reconginizes a specific color on the ground, all control of the vehicle is lost.

## Summary

Our project is a controlled “Bull”, where the user can control the animal’s movement and direction with a remote control. However, once this animal sees the color “red” of any kind, the user loses all control and the bull charges after the color. Once the “Bull” reaches the color red, it stops charging and the user is then given full control of the vehicle. We utalized a raspberry pi as we ll as a controller which we used bluetooth to connect with. Additionally, we used the servo motors to help steer our vehicle left and right by attaching them to the wheels. The idea additionally contained a camera which would be attahced to the raspberry pi and would recongnize the color red on the ground. A signal would then be sent to the remote which would ultimately allow the bull to go wild. We tried to take the unique characteristics of an animal and apply them to something that is logical, digital, and unemotional. We took our electrical engineering classwork and used that knowledge to learn how to control, navigate, and automate a vehicle into something more than just a “vehicle”. Overall, viewers should be entertained with the project because they will have the opportunity to control something like a car, but also are able to connect to an animal that has emotions.

The main goal of the project is to combine a remote control in order to give the user an easy user experience, yet also add a challange to the user of not having any control at al. People will interact with the vehicle in two ways; one through the remote control and secondly they will develop an emotional attachment to the bull because of the way it "acts out" when it sees the color red. 


## Component Parts

From what pieces did you build your project?

Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use, and a block diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

## Challenges

A brief discussion of what was hard, challenging, or unexpected about your project.

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past five weeks?

- Week 1: Write proposal, obtain raspberry pi 
- Week 2: Start putting together the vehicle with acrylic cutouts, servo motors, and 6v DC motors
- Week 3: Add onto the structure the Raspberry pi and begin programming the vehicle to mov, both forward and back and left and right
- Week 4: Add the camera and connect the remote controll with bluetooth 
- Week 5: Present final project!
