# The RC Bull (You can't control me)

We propose to build an RC car that acts as a bull, where the user can control the animal’s
movement and direction with a remote control, but when the vehicle recognizes a specific color on the ground, all control of the vehicle is lost.

## Summary

Our project is a controlled “Bull”, where the user can control the animal’s movement and direction with a remote control. However, once this animal sees the color “red” of any kind, the user loses all control and the bull charges after the color. Once the “Bull” reaches the color red, it stops charging and the user is then given full control of the vehicle. We utilized a raspberry pi as well as a controller which we used bluetooth to connect with. Additionally, we used the servo motors to help steer our vehicle left and right by attaching them to the wheels. The idea additionally contained a camera which would be attached to the raspberry pi and would recognize the color red on the ground. A signal would then be sent to the remote which would ultimately allow the bull to go wild. We tried to take the unique characteristics of an animal and apply them to something that is logical, digital, and unemotional. We took our electrical engineering classwork and used that knowledge to learn how to control, navigate, and automate a vehicle into something more than just a “vehicle”. Overall, viewers should be entertained with the project because they will have the opportunity to control something like a car, but also are able to connect to an animal that has emotions.

The main goal of the project is to combine a remote control in order to give the user an easy user experience, yet also add a challenge to the user of not having any control at al. People will interact with the vehicle in two ways; one through the remote control and secondly they will develop an emotional attachment to the bull because of the way it "acts out" when it sees the color red.

## Component Parts
On the hardware side, we built the structure of the vehicle with an acrylic foundation. Then we added 4 DC motors that were used to turn the wheels of the vehicle. On top of the 2 rear motors we added servo motors that allowed the vehicle to turn left and right. 

To control the entire vehicle we used a raspberry pi. Giving signals to the raspberry pi (input) to move left and right was the controller that gave out signal (output). Additionally, the RC car was connected to the remote via a bluetooth connection between the raspberry pi and the remote. The servos received commands from the raspberry pi (input) which received its commands from the controller (output).The entire vehicle was powered by 8, 1.5v batteries (output)

## Challenges

Working with different hardware parts, the greatest challenge we knew we were going to face was compatibility. The raspberry pi gave us some trouble when connecting to the remote control through bluetooth. It took a lot of trial and error to get that signal to work properly. 

Additionally, connecting the camera to the raspberry pie was a challenge due to compatibility and outdated software. Working with bluetooth was also a challenge we had since none of us had worked with such technology before. We had to learn a lot through Youtube videos and Google searches. 

We also did not expect how long it would take to figure out how to make all the wheels move in the same direction as well as the angles of the servos to move in the correct way. 


## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past five weeks?

- Week 1: Write proposal, obtain raspberry pi 
- Week 2: Start putting together the vehicle with acrylic cutouts, servo motors, and 6v DC motors
- Week 3: Add onto the structure the Raspberry pi and begin programming the vehicle to mov, both forward and back and left and right
- Week 4: Add the camera and connect the remote control with bluetooth 
- Week 5: Present final project!
